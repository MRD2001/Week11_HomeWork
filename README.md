Machine Learning Models To predict credit risk

## Libraries Imported and Packages

- numpy : the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
- pandas : open source data analysis and manipulation tool 
- pathlib : provides classes representing file system paths with sementics for all operating systems
- Collections : built-in python module that implements specialised container data types as alternative to dict, list, set 
- sklearn.metrics : simple tool for predictive data analysis. metrics module provides loss, score, and utility functions to measure classificaiton performance
- imblearn.metrics : toolbox for imbalanced dataset in machine learning

## Resampling

- Oversample the data using the Naive Random Oversampler and SMOTE algorithms.
- Undersample the data using the Cluster Centroids algorithm
- Oversample and undersample the data using the SMOTEENN algorithim.
- Generate the Balance Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix and Classification Report for all of the above methods.
